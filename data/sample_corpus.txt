And we'll never be royals

Wanna try?
To avoid complications
She never kept the same address
In conversation
She spoke just like a baroness
Met a man from China
Went down to Geisha Minah
Then again incidentally
If you're that way inclined
Perfume came naturally from Paris
For cars she couldn't care less
Fastidious and precise
She's a Killer Queen
Gunpowder, gelatin
Dynamite with a laser beam
Guaranteed to blow your mind
Anytime
Drop of a hat she's as willing as
Playful as a pussy cat

Temporarily out of gas

They threw outrageous parties; They paid heavenly bills

She pretended not to notice she was caught up in the race
Out every evenin' until it was light

Life in the fast lane everything all the time

Blowin' and burnin' blinded by thirst
They didn't see the stop sign; Took a turn for the worst

"We've been up and down this highway; haven't seen a god-damn thing."
He said, "Call the doctor. I think I'm gonna crash."
